        "Quality education is a fundamental right that every government/educational institution strives to provide. However, dropout rates in schools remain a persistent challenge, influenced by various social, economic, and demographic factors. Hence, there is a need for a comprehensive analysis of school-level dropout patterns to address this issue. By identifying the underlying causes and vulnerable groups, we aim to formulate targeted interventions that can significantly reduce dropout rates and ensure that every child completes their education. Thus, this model can help the government/education institutions."

        "This dataset provides a comprehensive view of students enrolled in various undergraduate degrees offered at a higher education institution. It includes demographic data, social-economic factors, and academic performance information that can be used to analyze the possible predictors of student dropout and academic success. This dataset contains multiple disjoint databases consisting of relevant information available at the time of enrollment, such as application mode, marital status, course chosen, and more. Additionally, this data can be used to estimate overall student performance at the end of each semester by assessing credited/enrolled/evaluated/approved curricular units and their respective grades. Finally, we have unemployment rate, inflation rate, and GDP from the region, which can help us further understand how economic factors play into student dropout rates or academic success outcomes. This powerful analysis tool will provide valuable insight into what motivates students to stay in school or abandon their studies in a wide range of disciplines such as agronomy, design, education, nursing, journalism, management, social service, or technologies."
